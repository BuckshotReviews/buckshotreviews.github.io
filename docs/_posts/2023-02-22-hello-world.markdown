# Hello world!

Hello! If you've somehow stumbled on this site, let me take a minute to explain what I'm doing here.

## What this site is

I have a weird hobby: I buy shotgun shells that contain buckshot, then I shoot them to see how they pattern. I made this site so that I can have
a place to put the data that isn't just a photo album on my phone.

I do this because I believe that shotguns have a valid role as defensive weapons for some people, and I like to help those people find quality
defensive ammunition. Shotgun dorks all seem to prefer Federal Flite Control or Hornady Critical Defense, but not everyone can find or afford it. 
While everyone needs to pattern their defensive shotgun load for themselves, I hope that I can help people choose likely good candidates.

## What this site is not

I'm not going to make a case for the validity of the shotgun as a defensive weapon. I actually think carbines are better all-around options for most
people, *if money is no object*. I just have a soft spot for shotguns, and there's plenty of good carbine information out there already. However,
a lot of the shotgun information out there is bad so I'd like to add some factual data.

I'm not going to present myself as an authority on terminal ballistics. This project begins and ends with "how big a pattern does load X throw from my
shotgun?" [Brassfetcher.com](https://brassfetcher.com/Shotguns/12%20Gauge%20Shotgun/12%20Gauge%20Shotgun.html) has some good reading on shotgun 
terminal ballistics if you're interested. John Correia has some fun material on his youtube channel, notably 
[this gel test video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VeeqLX0CZA). The Primary and Secondary shotgun modcasts also have some good material about 
shotgun terminal ballistics.

I'm also not an authority on how to set up or run a shotgun. Check out the aforementioned P&S shotgun modcasts, or even better take a class from a
reputable instructor. I have some formal training and match experience with shotguns but not enough that the Internet needs my opinions.
